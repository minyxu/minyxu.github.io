title: "About Me"
---

$\hspace{2em}My$ name is Minyuan Xu. I earned my Bachelor degree from the University of Iowa with a major of Actuarial Science. I am interested in Math and Stats. As this course is about visualization, most of this website will be composed of graphs. And for the $\href{https://github.com/anly503/anly503-fall2020-project-minyxu}{final\ project}$, we designed a dashboard of graphs analyzed from my chosen dataset. The project is about suicide rate around the world between 1985 and 2016. As the stress from life becomes greater and greater, suicide becomes a more severe problem, which deserves doing research on.
